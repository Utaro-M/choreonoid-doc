   # Installation
   cd /var/tmp
   sudo dpkg -i agx-setup-2.19.1.2-x64-ubuntu_16.04-double.deb    // Install the AGX Dynamics package
   ls -al /opt/Algoryx/AgX-2.19.1.2                               // Check AGX Dynamics is installed in the /opt/Alogrxy directory

   # Locate the AGX license file
   sudo cp -i agx.lic  /opt/Algoryx/AgX-2.19.1.2

   # Set the environment variables of AGX
   cd ~                                                           // Move to home dir
   cp -p .profile .profile_20171010                               // Backup .profile file for safety
   echo "source /opt/Algoryx/AgX-2.19.1.2/setup_env.bash" >> .profile
   diff .profile .profile_20171010                                // Check diff
   source .profile                                                // Set environment variables on this shell
   env | grep -i agx                                              // Check that AGX_DIR and AGX_BINARY_DIR are sat correctly

.. note::
   It can happen that some AGX programs do not work when you add the execution command of setup_env.bash in .profile because LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set appropriately.
   In the case, please add the execution command in .bashrc.
